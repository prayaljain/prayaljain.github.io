        <h2>👋 Hey there!</h2>
        <p>I’m Prayal Jain – a 13-year-old explorer of ideas, creativity, and fun tech!</p>
        <p>🎒 I’m currently studying in Grade 8 at 🏫 NH Goel World School, Raipur, Chhattisgarh.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a part of this wonderful school since Grade 1, and it’s given me so many exciting opportunities — like the Akhil Bhartiya Hindi exam and much more!</p>
        <h3>✨ A few things about me:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>📚 I love Math – it's challenging, logical, and super satisfying to solve problems!</li>
            <li>🎾 Sports I enjoy: Lawn tennis, throwball, cricket, and more. I like being active and trying different games.</li>
            <li>🎨 Creativity is my superpower – I love exploring technology, editing videos/photos, and making fun digital content.</li>
            <li>🎤 Indian Classical Vocal – I’ve been learning since Grade 5 and now I’m in my 4th year of a 6-year course. It’s a big part of my creative life!</li>
            <li>🛠️ I’m a quick fix person – if something’s broken, I’m already figuring it out. 😄</li>
        </ul>
